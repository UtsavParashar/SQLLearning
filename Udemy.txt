SQL Theory -

It's a declarative language i.e you don't have to tell sql how to divide the task and get the things done. It has SQL optimizer to create sub task and do the job.
You just need to tell SQL, get me this data and you are done.
Concentration is what you require rather then how to find what you require.

As a declarative language, it has following 4 components:
1. DDL - Data Definition Language
2. DML - Data Manipulation Language
3. DCL - Data Control Language
4. TCL - Transaction Control Language
