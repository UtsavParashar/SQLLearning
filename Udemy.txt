SQL Theory -

It's a declarative language i.e you don't have to tell sql how to divide the task and get the things done. It has SQL optimizer to create sub task and do the job.
You just need to tell SQL, get me this data and you are done.
Concentration is what you require rather then how to find what you require.

As a declarative language, it has following 4 components:
1. DDL - Data Definition Language
2. DML - Data Manipulation Language
3. DCL - Data Control Language
4. TCL - Transaction Control Language

DDL
----
SQLs Syntax - Comprises of several types of statements that allow you to perform various commands and operations.

DDL - A set of statements that allow the user to define or modify data structures and objects, such as tables.

Create Statement - Create Database and Database objects like tables.
-----------------
Syntax :
    CREATE OBJECT_TYPE object_name;

Eg. CREATE TABLE table_name (column_name, datetype);
CREATE TABLE  sales (purchare_number, INT);

It is a common practise to have same name of the database and its main table.

Alter Statement - Alter a table by adding removing renaming column names
---------------
Eg. ALTER TABLE sales
ADD COLUMN purchase_date DATE;


DROP/Delete a table/database:
-----------------------------
DROP OBJECT object_name;
DROP TABLE sales;

RENAME - To rename a table/column etc.
-------
RENAME TABLE sales TO customer_sales;

TRUNCATE Statement:
-------------------
To clear all data i.e elements of the table but the keep the schema of the table, we can go with TRUNCATE statement.
TRUNCATE OBJECT object_name;
TRUNCATE TABLE customers;

SQL Keywords: ~ RESERVED WORDS
-------------
ADD, RENAME, ALTER(ADD, REMOVE), DROP, TRUNCATE etc

Keywords in SQL cannot be variable names - objects and databases cannot have names that coincides with SQL keywords.


DML - Data Manipulation Language
================================
The statements that allows us to manipulate data in the tables of a database.

SELECT Statement - used to retrieve data from db objects like tables.
----------------- Eg: SELECT * FROM TABLE;
SELECT * FROM sales;

Generalized version
SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE

INSERT Statement - used to insert data into tables.
-----------------
It goes hand in hand with keywords -- INTO and VALUES

Generalized version
INSERT INTO ... VALUES

Eg
INSERT INTO sales (purchare_number, purchase_date) VALUES (1, '2021-01-01')  -- OR
INSERT INTO sales VALUES (2, '2021-03-02') -- Since we have two columns, values will be entered in positional sequence.

UPDATE Statement - allows you to update/renew existing data of your tables.
----------------
It goes hand in hand with

Generalized version
UPDATE .... SET .... WHERE

Eg. UPDATE sales
    SET  purchase_date='2021-03-01'
    WHERE purchare_number=1;

DELETE Statement - It works similar to the TRUNCATE statement from DDL.
----------------
With a diff - DELETE vs TRUNCATE
TRUNCATE removes all the data from the table i.e clear all elements from the table whereas
DELETE can either remove all elements or we can precisely specify what all rows are to be removed by providing the condition with where clause.

DELETE FROM sale; -- works similar to TRUNCATE i.e
TRUNCATE TABLE sales;

Generalized version -- DELETE ... FROM ... WHERE

But if we want to delete a row based on condition then we can go with:
DELETE FROM sales
WHERE purchase_date='2021-03-01'; -- This will remove only one horizontal entity from the table.

Generalized versions of DML Language Statements:
SELECT -- SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE
INSERT -- INSERT INTO ... VALUES
UPDATE -- UPDATE ... SET ... WHERE
DELETE -- DELETE ... FROM ... WHERE

DCL - Data Control Language
=============================
It includes two statements
GRANT and REVOKE - allows us to make rights users have in a db.

GRANT - GRANT gives or grants certain permissions to users
-------
Syntax - GRANT type_of_permission
         ON database_name.table_name
         TO 'username'@'localhost'

From this statement a user can be granted a certain permission (SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/CREATE/ALTER(ADD,REMOVE)/DROP/TRUNCATE/RENAME) to one of many tables of a db.

Eg. GRANT SELECT
    ON salesDb.customers_table
    TO 'frank'@'euhost'

This statement will provide ONLY select permission to user frank on table customers_table of salesDb database.

To grant all permission to frank on salesDb we can use:
GRANT ALL
ON salesdb.*
TO 'frank'@'euhost'

Database Admin - People who have complete rights to the db are db admin they can grant access to users and can revoke it.
---------------

REVOKE - used to revoke permissions of the users, it is the exact opposite of GRANT.
-------
Eg. REVOKE SELECT
    ON salesdb.customers_table
    FROM 'frank'@'euhost'
